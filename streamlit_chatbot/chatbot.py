Dear Dad,

On this special day, I just want to say thank you for everything you've done for me.
Your love, guidance, and strength have shaped me into who I am today.

You've been my superhero, my mentor, and my greatest supporter.
I'm truly grateful for your presence in my life.

Wishing you the happiest Father's Day!

With love,  
Your Child
